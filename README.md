This is a 2D roguelike dungeon-themed game designed using the Unity game engine.


## Game Story

The game begins with a student working on an essay assignment at home. They go to bed and and awake in the morning to find their essay gone. You’re the student, trapped in a library and you’re trying to escape! The library has come alive and you’re trying to find a way out. Pages of the essay you were writing before bed last night seem to be scattered throughout the library; could this be a nightmare?
